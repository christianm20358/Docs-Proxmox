<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository is for documentation of my home lab. It will have a primary focus on Cybersecurity. The goal at the end of the project is to harden a small LAN according to the CIS 18 framework. The main interface server handling the majority of the network administration is a dedicated server with Proxmox, a debian based virtual environment that is ideal for managing multiple virtual machines and can also contain docker images. Some combination of the two will likely perform most of the network management.

Here's why:

* I believe in learning by doing. I would like to implement security controls on my network that don't impact usability but improve security.
* I want to find or create tools that I would want to use myself, not only to improve security, but also to improve quality of life for network users.
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
